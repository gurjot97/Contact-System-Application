1. The following two functions "findContactIndex" and "getTenDigitPhone" were very beneficial to this assignment's source code by keeping it maintained and readable because these functions were used very frequently in the source code. More specifically, these 2 functions were used in the "searchContacts", "updateContacts", and "deleteContacts" functions, so it was very crucial to keep these functions separate from the contact functions since this increases the readability of the source code, the "findContactIndex" and "getTenDigitPhone" function identifier names were concise and clearly indicates their purpose, it is much better than seeing large chunks of repetitive/complicated code. These functions also promote source code maintenance since the same code isn't being repeated everywhere, it is written once under the appropriate function, and they can be called anywhere within the file (or by using a header file) to perform the applicable task. Also, since the code is written in one place, it can also be edited in one place too, this substantially increases code maintainability because if the same code was written everywhere in the source code, editing the same code everywhere will become very time consuming, difficult, and overall very inefficient, but it will also lead to creating more confusion and errors.

2. I've learned a lot from this assignment, I learned to create functions that are very high in cohesion, and low in coupling, some of these examples could be the clearKeyboard, pause, getInt, yes, menu functions and many more. I also learned how some of the simple functions in this assignment can be called by other functions to perform larger and complex tasks, one example can be the searchContacts function, it required both the findContactIndex and getTenDigitPhone functions to perform a larger and complex task of searching for a specific contact by using their cell phone number. I also learned about the String library, I've learned how to use the strlen, strcmp, and strcpy functions to perform specific tasks during this assignment. Overall, these are few of the things that I learned in this assignment, and it will definitely help improve my code efficiency and maintainability in the coming future.
